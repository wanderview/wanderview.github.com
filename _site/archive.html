support this kind of processing.</p>

        </h3><p>About <a href="/blog/2014/12/08/implementing-the-serviceworker-cache-api-in-gecko/">two months ago I wrote</a> that the Service Worker Cache code was entering
code review.  Our thought at the time was to quickly transition all of the
work that had been done on the maple project branch back into Nightly.  The
project branch wasn’t really needed any more and the code could more easily be
tested by the community on Nightly.</p>

            Implementing the Service Worker Cache API in Gecko
          </a>
        </h3><p>For the last few months I’ve been heads down, implementing the Service Worker
Cache API in gecko.  All the work to this point has been done on a <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/maple/file/tip/dom/cache">project
branch</a>, but the code is finally reaching a point where it can land in
mozilla-central.  Before this can happen, of course, it needs to be peer
reviewed.  Unfortunately this patch is going to be large and complex.  To
ease the pain for the reviewer I thought it would be helpful to provide a
high-level description of how things are put together.</p>

against real, captured network data.  I was rather happy with
how that module turned out, so I decided to mock out <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/dgram.html">dgram</a> next in order
to support testing UDP packets as well.</p>

        </h3><p>Automated unit tests are a wonderful thing.  They help give you the
confidence to make difficult changes and are your first line of
defense against regressions.  Unfortunately, however, unit tests
typically only validate code against the same expectations and
pre-conceived notions we used to write the code in the first place.
All to often we later find our expectations do not match reality.</p>

The Mac only wants to use modern versions of SMB to share

this issue I’ve turned to hacking on ancient protocols in <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a>.</p>
