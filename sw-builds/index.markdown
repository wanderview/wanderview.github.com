Custom builds are no longer needed to test Service Workers. Please use an
up-to-date [Firefox Nightly][] for all Service Worker testing.

If you encounter any issues, please [file a bug][] in the "DOM" component.

---------

The older custom builds can still be accessed here.  Please be aware these
are quite old now and you probably shouldn't use them.
